            <h2>About Myself</h2>

            <p style="width: 900px; ">Hello! My name is Dilsan Basnet. I am 15 years old and live in Tilottama-4,
                Dingarnagar. I
                am currently studying at Kalika Manavgyan Secondary School. I have a deep passion for coding,
                programming, and
                software development. My dream is to become a skilled developer, specializing in web and software
                development
                using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.

                Apart from coding, I enjoy playing sports like cricket and football. I come from a loving family of
                five,
                including my father, mother, grandmother, and brother, who always support me in my journey. I also have
                a best
                friend, Samriddha Poudel, who has been an important part of my life.

                I am constantly learning and improving my skills to build innovative software solutions. My goal is to
                create
                impactful applications and contribute to the tech industry. Thank you!"**

            <img src="images/kmgss.jpg" alt="KMGSS" width="600px">
            <p style="font-size: 19px; width: 1000px;"> Manavgyan Secondary School is located in Butwal
                <q>Sub-metropolitan
                    City, Ward No. 10, Kalikanagar (Sector-1) </q>and Ramnagar (Sector-2), Rupandehi, Lumbini Province.
                It
                was
                established in 1961 A.D (2018 B.S) with the assistance of local residents, many of whom were ex-army
                personnel.
                They recognized the importance of educating their children, which led to the establishment of the school
                in
                an
                open ground in the southern part of Kalikanagar. After a few months, the school was relocated to a cow
                shed
                before settling in its current location
                Initially, the school started as a primary school and was later upgraded to a lower secondary level in
                2029
                B.S.
                Finally, in 2032 B.S, it became a secondary-level school. Kalika Secondary School provides both general
                and
                technical education. In the general stream, we offer classes from Early Childhood Development (ECD) to
                grade
                12.
                In the technical stream, we provide Computer Engineering courses from grades 9 to 12.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>My hobbies include coding, playing cricket, and reading, each of which brings me joy and personal growth
                in
                different ways. Coding allows me to be creative and solve problems, helping me develop logical thinking
                and
                build useful applications. Playing cricket is a great way for me to stay active, improve teamwork
                skills,
                and
                enjoy the thrill of the game. Reading, on the other hand, expands my knowledge and imagination, whether
                I‚Äôm
                exploring fiction or learning something new from non-fiction books. These hobbies not only keep me
                engaged
                but
                also help me improve my skills and relax in my free time.
